            <h2>Jadav Payeng's life and career</h2>
            <p>Jadav &quot;Molai&quot; Payeng (born 1963) is an environmental activist and forestry worker from Majuli,
                popularly known as the Forest Man of India. Over the course of several decades, he has planted and
                tended trees on a sandbar of the river Brahmaputra turning it into a forest reserve. The forest, called
                Molai forest after him, is located near Kokilamukh of Jorhat, Assam, India and encompasses an area of
                about 1,360 acres / 550 hectares. In 2015, he was honoured with Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian
                award in India. He was born in the indigenous Mising tribe of Assam.</p>
            <p>In 1979, Payeng, then 16, encountered a large number of snakes that had died due to excessive heat after
                floods washed them onto the tree-less sandbar. That is when he planted around 20 bamboo seedlings on the
                sandbar. He started working on the forest in 1979 when the social forestry division of Golaghat district
                launched a scheme of tree plantation on 200 hectares at Aruna Chapori situated at a distance of 5 km
                from Kokilamukh in Jorhat district. Molai was one of the labourers who worked in that project which was
                completed after five years. He chose to stay back after the completion of the project even after other
                workers left. He not only looked after the plants, but continued to plant more trees on his own, in an
                effort to transform the area into a forest.</p>
